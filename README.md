### How to Run the Torchie App 

- Prerequisites

1. Python Installation: Ensure you have Python installed on your machine (preferably version 3.6 or later). You can download it from the official Python website.

2. Install Required Libraries: Torchie requires several Python libraries. You can install them using pip. Open your command line or terminal and run:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- Clone the Repository

    ```bash

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/torchie.git
    ```

- Navigate to the Project Directory:

    ```bash
    cd torchie
    ```

- Set Up Groq API

1. Obtain Your Groq API Key:
    Follow the steps mentioned  to sign up at Groq's official website and obtain your API key.

2. Store Your API Key:
    Create a configuration file (e.g., `config.py`) or use environment variables to securely store your Groq API key. Hereâ€™s an example of how to do this in a `.env` file:

    ```python

        GROQ_API_KEY = "YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY"  
    ``` 

- Run the Application

    Start the Gradio Server: Run the following command to start the server:

    ```bash

    python app.py
    ```

    If you are using Jupyter Notebook, you can also run:

    ```bash

    !python app.py
    ```

    Access the Application: Once the server is running, open your web browser and go to:

    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:5000
    ```
